I haven't tested this file in Elm 0.18.  We may have to make some
small changes for that.

Look at the last few lines of `src/Network.elm`, beginning with  
`-- TEST DATA`.  To run the example, do this (Elm 0.19)

```
$ elm repl 
> import Network 
> listNodeNames net
> listEdgeNames net
> listEdgeNamesWithFlow net
> efficiency net 
> resilience net
> sustainabilityPercentage net
