I haven't tested this file in Elm 0.18.  We may have to make some
small changes for that.

Look at the last few lines of `src/Network.elm`, beginning with  
`-- TEST DATA`.  To run the example, do this (Elm 0.19)

```
$ elm repl 
> import Network 
> listNodeNames net
> listEdgeNames net
> listEdgeNamesWithFlow net
> efficiency net 
> resilience net
> sustainabilityPercentage net 
```
 
The example here is that of case 2:

> listNodeNames net
  ["U1","U2","U3","U4"]

> listEdgeNamesWithFlow net
["U1->U4: 30","U1->U2: 90.4","U4->U3: 22","U2->U3: 31.4"]

> efficiency net
154.67733751835925 : Float

> resilience net
149.71922770403455 : Float

> alpha net
0.5081441618940449 : Float

> sustainabilityPercentage net
0.97 : Float

This is in agreement with the excel
spreadsheet.
